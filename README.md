# Project-1B
General Information
A simple variant of whack-a-mole game, except you click a ball this time round.

User Story
Your speed is put to the test. A soccer ball will appear anywhere on the soccer pitch and you score a point if the ball is clicked on before it disappears. The player with the higher score at the end of the game wins.

Major bottlenecks
Setting event listener for mouse click on the ball image that is drawn on canvas
Scaling the difficulties level

Thanks
Prima: Much help in refactoring my codes which were getting increasingly messy and confusing at one point, even to myself. And for telling me that drawing anything over canvas means that it cannot be picked up and identified as an object.
Kailin and Glen: The early part of the project needed direction and they provided much guidance on the technical issues. Many of my questions were really amateurish but both TAs showed great patience.
WDI 6: Every single feedback and suggestions given, of which there were many. Alex and Zhi Hong, who have been sitting beside me for the past few days were my go-to guys and helped to look through my codes when I got really stuck. Chris, Fauzi and Huda gave great suggestions on finetuning the game.
